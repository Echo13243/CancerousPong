# CancerousPong
It's a cancerous version of pong, what else? Name by Robert Hsu
Run the JAR to play

###Warning -
Works well on monitors 1920 x 1080 and higher, unknown results on lower resolution monitors. <br>
Resizing the window moves some of the text and does not make the overall game larger, trust me, I tried. <br>
Refer to desc. if the game does not seem to be starting.

###Description -
Every time the ball hits the paddle, it speeds up. <br>
You can set a custom score limit at the bottom of the screen, but be sure to press tab afterwards so the application will register the key you press to play.
